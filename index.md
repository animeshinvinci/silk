## Your Data is Now Scalable
[Silk](./) is a new data model for describing **relations** (tables), **trees** and **streams**. This flexible data model enables us to manage various types of data in a unified framework. 


Silk supports mapping from existing structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and flat data (e.g., CVS, tap-separated data). When managing large volumes of data as in **genome sciences**, in which tera-bytes of data are commonly used, you can use stream-based mapping to Silk from biological data formats (e.g., BED, WIG, FASTA, SAM/BAM, etc.). 

**Silk Weaver** is a new DBMS based on Silk, designed to handle massive amount of data sets using multi-core CPUs in cluster machines.
