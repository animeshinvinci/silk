## Your Data is Now Scalable
**Silk** is a new data model for describing **relations** (tables), **trees** and **streams**. This flexible data model enables us to manage various types of data in a unified framework.

**Silk Weaver** is a new open-source DBMS based on Silk data model. Silk Weaver is designed to handle massive amount of data sets using multi-core CPUs in cluster machines. Once mapping to Silk is established, your data is ready to process in parallel and distributed environment.

Silk supports handy mapping from existing structured data (e.g., JSON, XML) and flat data formats (e.g., CVS, tap-separated data). When managing large volumes of data you can use stream-based mapping to Silk. For example, in **genome sciences** tera-bytes of data are commonly used, and various types of biological formats need to be managed (e.g., BED, WIG, FASTA, SAM/BAM formats etc.) 

Silk Weaver intergrates these data sets and provides a uniform query interface which can be accessed from command-line or [Scala API](.).
